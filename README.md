# ADVENT OF CODE 2023

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges.

This is my first year participating in the Advent of Code, and I'm excited to see how far I can get!

I'm not doing this for getting the best time or anything (Python is probably the best language for that), but rather to have fun.

## Solutions

Those are the solutions I've used to get the answers for the challenges.

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 |
| --- | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | [Solution](day-1/src/bin/part_1.rs) | [Solution](day-1/src/bin/part_2.rs) |
| 2 | [Solution](day-2/src/bin/part_1.rs) | [Solution](day-2/src/bin/part_2.rs) |
| 3 | [Solution](day-3/src/bin/part_1.rs) | [Solution](day-3/src/bin/part_2.rs) |
| 4 | [Solution](day-4/src/bin/part_1.rs) | [Solution](day-4/src/bin/part_2.rs) |
| 5 | [Solution](day-5/src/bin/part_1.rs) | [Solution](day-5/src/bin/part_2.rs) |
| 6 | [Solution](day-6/src/bin/part_1.rs) | [Solution](day-6/src/bin/part_2.rs) |
| 7 | [Solution](day-7/src/part_1/mod.rs) | [Solution](day-7/src/part_2/mod.rs) |

## Redos

I've decided to redo some of the challenges that I didn't like the first time around.

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 |  Comments |
| --- | ------ | ------ | --------- |
| 4 | [Solution](day-4/src/bin/part_1_redo.rs) | [Solution](day-4/src/bin/part_2_redo.rs) | Recursion was a bad idea. |
| 5 | - | [Solution](day-5-redo/src/bin/part_2.rs) | Brute-forcing my way through the solution took too long. |
